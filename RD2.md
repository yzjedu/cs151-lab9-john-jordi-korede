The goal of this lab was getting used to using lists and being able to store data in them.
Also, I think I was to learn how to get better at using loops and dealing with output and input for when I'm using files.
We had to create many separate functions in order to complete the task efficiently.
Also, with functions it allows for the code itself to run smoother and have less clutter. 
What were the Key concepts explored? The key concepts that were explored in this lab was creating our own functions to help solve the problem at hand.\
In addition, another key concept that was explored throughout this lab was dealing with input and output of files provided by the user.
Yes, we were able to get the desired results.
We also tried several times with different files to ensure that the program worked for every file.
Some challenges that we encountered was figuring what functions we needed exactly to figure out the solution to the problem.
We ensured that we followed the 3 rules of programming by first listing the problem from the user, how we plan to solve, and then created an algorithm, so that we could create the userâ€™s desired program.
Yes I believe that I learned what I suppose to for this lab
I enjoyed working with John and Korede.
