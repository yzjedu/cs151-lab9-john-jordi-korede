I enjoyed learning a lot of new things in this lab. In this, formatting tables proved to be a big
task from this workload, and I enjoyed trying to wrap my head around it. I had to resort to using some
external resources like Python.org and Google for Education's webpages on Python tutorials to understand a lot
of it. Eventually, it made sense, and this helped me out when trying to do and help the algorithm and the 
code with my teammates.

I am satisfied with the way that the code turned out here. Reading and formatting external files is something
that is going to come very handy when dealing with a lot of later subjects in this CS151 course. Every little bit of
Python that I learn feels important in their own right and I'm happy to commit to
learning this programming language.
