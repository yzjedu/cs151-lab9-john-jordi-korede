### Blind Test: Running the code

| Result     | Description                                                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **YES-** | Asks the user for an input file name                                                    |
| **YES-** | Asks user to try again if input file name doesn't exist (try `bbb.txt`)                 |
| **YES-** | Works  with `yalew.txt`, `sibren.txt`, and `nweke.txt`. |
| **YES-** | The number of tables should be the length of file divided by 5 |
| **YES-** | Try all three files again. Each table should have 5 people at each table                |
| **YES-** | Output of assignments has `~~~~~` lines between each, or something similar              |
| **YES-** | For each person, it lists Table number, Seat number, Name                               |

### Open Test: Looking at the code

| Result     | Description                                                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **YES-** | The algorithm matches the code                                           |
| **YES-** | Purpose of the program is clearly stated |  
| **YES-** | There is at least one for loop in the code                                              |
| **YES-** | All loops except for error checking on user input is a loop                             |
| **-NO** | Error checking on user input `filename` with  `while os.path.isfile(filename)` |
| **YES-** | There is a function for error checking file name that returns file name                 |
| **YES-** | There is a function for reading from the file that returns a list of names              |
| **YES-** | There is a function for determining and outputting table assignments                    |


### Documents for Participation Grade

|Result         |Type            |
|---------------|----------------|
|**-NO** | Reflection 1   |
|**YES-** | Reflection 2   |
|**YES-** | Reflection 3   |
|**YES-** | Algorithm      |

### Comments on the grading
- `seat` and `table` variables are not used in the for loop
- Should have used `while os.path.isfile(filename)`
- 

### Grade: M

### Participation Grade: S
U for Korde
 - If participation grade is unsatisfactory check the `NO` in the documents sections
