In this lab, we had to read information and data from another file in order to organize
and display what was contained in it. We had to go through all the names of the people
in the files and put them at tables and seats for a party in the future. On its own, the
program was simple to make after getting all the data from the files into a manageable
list, but the main hurtle came from the display part. The loops I had were a little confusing
because they were nested in a way that I thought would cause the program to run correctly.
However, the correct way was to actually reverse two of the loops so that the outer one was
the inner one and vice versa. Another thing that I discovered was that while loops and for loops
nested in each other can get a bit buggy, which caused me to redo a portion of the code.

I think this lab was interesting because it subverted my expectations and forced me to approach
the problem in a different way than I initially anticipated. It was an interesting learning experience.
